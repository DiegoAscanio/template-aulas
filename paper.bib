	abstract = {The importance of this research was to highlight the use of interactive digital presentations in the classroom that allow students to interact with the lesson content, work independently, and answer various questions presented on these interactive slides. We used the Pear Deck add-on to create these interactive presentations. The research had a quasiexperimental design and was conducted with two seventh-grade classes in the primary school “Naim Frasheri” in Prishtina, where one of them played the role of the experimental group while the other had the role of the control group. Data collection instruments were used in two tests (pre-test and post-test), a questionnaire for students in the experimental class, and the method of observation in both classes. From the data collected from the questionnaire, we measured the positive effects on students’ motivation to learn and the positive effects on achievement were measured by testing students, while our attitudes as a teacher were reflected through the observation process. The results of this study have shown that the use of interactive digital presentations has a positive effect on the memorization of concepts and students’ engagement and that this kind of presentations are more efficient to use during the technology class compared to traditional learning methods.},
